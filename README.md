## üñºÔ∏è Final Render Statistics

- **Resolution:** `1200 √ó 675`
- **Samples per Pixel:** `500`
- **Total Render Time:** `6.11 hours (22,004.9 seconds)`
- **Machine:** `Apple MacBook Pro with M1 chip (single-threaded)`

This render was generated using a CPU-based path tracer implemented in C++, based on the approach outlined in [_Ray Tracing in One Weekend_](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).  
The renderer currently runs in **single-threaded mode**. Future versions will incorporate **multithreading** for faster rendering.
